# MovieBlend
Display a black fullscreen application to stop distracting you when watching your favourite movies.

# Usage
Simply excecute the provided jar-file _(should work on every platform where java 10+ is supported)_ and click the opened window as long as you don't like the monitor which it blends. Currently it is programmed for 2 Monitors only, but you can execute the tool more than once of course to configure this to your needs.

To close the blend, you will need to use your task-bar or the task-manager.

# Contribution
Feel free to extend the tool in any way you would like. I will review the changes and if I like them I will add them to the main-branch.
